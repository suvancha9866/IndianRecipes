    "text": "Section 2: Exploratory Data Analysis\nLet’s examine this data. I want to do this by looking at graphs, which I can use to answer many questions.\n\n1. What is the distribution of dishes from each state? What about each region?\n\nstates &lt;- india |&gt; \n  group_by(state) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  mutate(state = ifelse(state == \"-1\", \"Other\", \n                        state)\n         ) |&gt; \n  arrange(state) |&gt; \n  rename(count = n)\n\n\nstate_graph &lt;- ggplot(states, \n                      mapping = aes(x=state,\n                                    y=count,\n                                    fill=state,\n                                    text = paste(\"State: \", state, \"\\n\",\n                                                 \"Count: \", count, sep=\"\"))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Dishes per State in Dataset\",\n       x = \"State\",\n       y = \"Number of Dishes\") +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"serif\",\n                            color = \"black\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 80,\n                                   size = 10,\n                                   hjust = .9,\n                                   color = \"black\"\n                                   ),\n        axis.line.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, \n                                  size=20),\n        legend.position = \"none\"\n        )\n\n\nggplotly(state_graph, tooltip = \"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is apparent that some states are very overrepresented in this dataset, like Gujurat, Punjab, and Maharashtra. Some states do not have that many dishes in this dataset, like Tripura, Chhattisgarh, and Nagaland. With this knowledge, any analysis that we do that includes the states will not be accurate because not every state is represented equally. But that doesn’t stop us from exploring this dataset.\n\nregions &lt;- india |&gt; \n  group_by(region) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  mutate(region = ifelse(region == \"-1\", \"Other\", \n                         region\n                       )\n         ) |&gt; \n  arrange(region) |&gt; \n  rename(count = n)\n\n\nregion_graph &lt;- ggplot(regions, \n                       mapping = aes(x=region,\n                                     y=count,\n                                     fill=region,\n                                     text = paste(\"Region: \", region, \"\\n\",\n                                                  \"Count: \", count, sep=\"\"))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Dishes per Region in Dataset\",\n       x = \"Region\",\n       y = \"Number of Dishes\") +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"serif\",\n                            color = \"black\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 80,\n                                   size = 15,\n                                   hjust = .5,\n                                   color = \"black\"\n                                   ),\n        axis.line.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, \n                                  size=20),\n        legend.position = \"none\"\n        )\n\n\nggplotly(region_graph, tooltip = \"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is also not a uniform distribution as West and South dominate North East and Central India. But that will not stop me from looking at this dataset more.\n\n\n2. How many different Flavor Profiles/Courses are there in this dataset?\n\nflavor_profiles &lt;- india |&gt; \n  group_by(flavor_profile) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(flavor_profile) |&gt; \n  rename(count = n)\n\n\nflavor_profiles_graph &lt;- ggplot(flavor_profiles, \n                                mapping = aes(x=flavor_profile,\n                                              y=count,\n                                              fill=flavor_profile,\n                                              text = paste(\"Flavor Profile: \", flavor_profile, \"\\n\",\n                                                           \"Count: \", count, sep=\"\"))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Dishes per Flavor Profile in Dataset\",\n       x = \"Flavor Profiles\",\n       y = \"Number of Dishes\") +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"serif\",\n                            color = \"black\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, \n                                  size=20),\n        legend.position = \"none\"\n        ) + coord_flip() + \n  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(\"sweet\",\"spicy\",\"sour\", \"savory\", \"bitter\"),\n                   labels=c(\"Sweet\", \"Spicy\", \"Sour\", \"Savory\", \"Bitter\"))\n\n\nggplotly(flavor_profiles_graph, tooltip = \"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that there is a lot of Spicy foods listed with Sweet foods following closely. However, we do not have a lot of Sour, Bitter, or Savory foods compared to the other two flavor profiles.\n\ncourses &lt;- india |&gt; \n  group_by(course) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(course) |&gt; \n  rename(count = n)\n\n\ncourses_graph &lt;- ggplot(courses, \n                        mapping = aes(x=course,\n                                      y=count,\n                                      fill=course,\n                                      text = paste(\"Course: \", course, \"\\n\",\n                                                   \"Count: \", count, sep=\"\"))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Dishes per Course in Dataset\",\n       x = \"Course\",\n       y = \"Number of Dishes\") +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"serif\",\n                            color = \"black\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, \n                                  size=20),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\n        ) + coord_flip() + \n  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(\"starter\",\"snack\",\"main course\", \"dessert\"),\n                   labels=c(\"Starter\", \"Snack\", \"Main Course\", \"Dessert\"))\n\n\nggplotly(courses_graph, tooltip = \"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is also a pretty uneven split amongst the different Courses. Just keep this as food for though.\n\n\n3. What percent of the food in this dataset are vegetarian/non-vegetarian?\n\ndiets &lt;- india |&gt; \n  group_by(diet) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(diet) |&gt; \n  rename(count = n)\n\n\ndiets_graph &lt;- ggplot(diets,\n                      mapping = aes(x=\"\",\n                                    y=diet,\n                                    fill=diet)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) +\n  theme_void()  +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Dishes that are Veg/Non-Veg in Dataset\",\n    fill = \"Diet\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"serif\",\n                            color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size=20, \n                              hjust=.5)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Diet\", labels = c(\"Non-Vegetarian\", \"Vegetarian\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#fc8d62\", \"#66c2a5\"))\ndiets_graph\n\n\n\n\nWell this is certainly very un-even. However, if you remember, North and West India dominate this dataset, and those are usually more vegetarian due to religious reasons.\nNow that we have examined all five characteristics of this dataset and found that they are not uniformly distributed, all of our further answering and analysis will be contained within this dataset. This will make sense as we proceed with this analysis."
